# Welcome to the Remult Tutorial

Hey there, and welcome to the Remult Tutorial! ðŸ‘‹

Remult is a full-stack JavaScript library designed to simplify the development of data-driven applications. It provides:

- A powerful Backend ORM
- Zero-boilerplate CRUD REST & Realtime APIs
- A type-safe API client for the Frontend
- TypeScript entities as a single source of truth (SSO) for:
  - Authorization
  - Validation
  - Entity-related business logic

By embracing the principles of SSO, Remult streamlines the process of building CRUD applications, making your development experience smoother and more efficient.

## The Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the creation of a full-stack todo app, similar to the one you see in the `preview` window on the right.

We'll cover:

- Setting up a REST API
- Integrating with the Frontend
- Implementing paging, sorting, and filtering
- Performing insert, update, and delete operations
- Enabling realtime updates
- Adding validation
- Writing backend methods
- Implementing authentication & authorization
